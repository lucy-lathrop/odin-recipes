    <li>Sesame oil</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>
    <li>Brown sugar</li>

    <li>Ground mustard</li>
    <li>Ground ginger</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, 
      ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. 
      Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade 
      for basting.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and place salmon into the marinade. 
      Squeeze air out of the bag, seal, and marinate the salmon steaks for at least 1 hour 
      (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and discard used marinade.</li>
    <li>Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. 
      Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved 
      marinade, turn, and broil until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. 
      Brush again with marinade.</li>
  </ol>
